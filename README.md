# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I have been working on schizophrenia research using EEG and the Free Energy Principle.
Currently, I have dropped out of the research path and am pioneering a career as an engineer.

I am interested in searching for the latest technology trends.
I am passionate about mobile application development with Flutter. Here’s a brief overview of the technologies I excel in:
